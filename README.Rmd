## Installation
```{r}
remotes::install_github("poissonconsulting/teckfish")
```


## Example

calculate_gsdd() takes a numerical vector and returns a sum of the growing degree days. 
``` r
library(teckfish)
day <- 1:365
x <- -15 * cos((2*pi / 365) * (day-10)) + rnorm(365, mean = 10, sd = .5)

calculate_gsdd(x=x, rollmean_units = 7, start_temp = 5, end_temp = 4, n_consecutive = 5)
```
