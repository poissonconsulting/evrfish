# teckfish

## Introduction

`teckfish` is an R package for Teck Fish and Aquatic Sciences Projects.
It is intended to be used by Teck staff and contractors and anyone else
who finds it useful.

The intention is to eventually migrate it to the [Teck Resources RDS
GitHub organization](https://github.com/TeckResourcesTDS).

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("poissonconsulting/teckfish")
```

## Demonstration

### Growing Season Degree Days

`gsdd_cf()` takes a numerical vector of mean daily temperature values in
centigrade and calculates the growing season degree days (GSDD) based on
Coleman and Fauschâ€™s (2007) definition.

``` r
library(teckfish)
gsdd_cf(teckfish::simulated_data$synthetic)
#> [1] 3898.806
```
